# ASRock H470 Hackintosh

An OC configuration for my Hackintosh desktop.

## FAQ

- Why Hackintosh?  
  To express my dissatisfaction with macOS 11.0 Big Sur and Apple Inc.

- Why Hackintosh at this time?  
  Because I'm lazy and I met lots of trouble. This plan was started after WWDC 2020. It has been proceeding for months.

I'm also seeking help for these problems.
